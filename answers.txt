1. How do you determine the number of threads
you should launch to realistically test your application?
	Test how many threads will get unexpected behavior before
	the mutex is implemented. Test the same number after implementing the 
	mutex and see expected behavior if everything else is correct.

2. If you are launching several threads, under what circumstances would
these threads not run in parallel on a modern processor?
	If you have a number of threads greater than twice the number of
	CPUs, they cannot all run in parallel.
